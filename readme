Fine-Tuning Task README
Overview
This repository contains code for fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model for a specific task. Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to perform a new task, typically with a smaller dataset than what was used for pre-training.

Model
The pre-trained model used for this fine-tuning task is [insert model name/version here]. This model has been pre-trained on a large dataset (e.g., ImageNet for vision tasks, WikiText for language tasks) and has learned general features that can be useful for a wide range of tasks.

Task
The task for which the model is being fine-tuned is [insert task description here]. This could be anything from image classification to text generation, depending on the capabilities of the pre-trained model.

Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning is [insert dataset name here]. This dataset should be representative of the task at hand and should be split into training, validation, and optionally test sets.

Requirements
Python >= 3.x
PyTorch >= [version]
[Any other specific libraries or dependencies]
Usage
Installation: Clone this repository and install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Data Preparation: Download the dataset and preprocess it as necessary. Make sure it's split into training, validation, and test sets.

Fine-Tuning: Run the fine-tuning script, providing the necessary arguments such as paths to the dataset and hyperparameters.

```
Copy code
python fine_tune.py --data_dir /path/to/dataset --batch_size 32 --epochs 10
Evaluation: Evaluate the fine-tuned model on the validation set to assess its performance.
```
```
Copy code
python evaluate.py --data_dir /path/to/dataset --checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint
Inference: Optionally, perform inference on new data using the fine-tuned model.
```
```
Copy code
python inference.py --data_dir /path/to/new_data --checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint
```
